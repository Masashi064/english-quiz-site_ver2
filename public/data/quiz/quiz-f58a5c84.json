    {
      "question": "What is one major advantage of a space elevator over rockets for getting cargo into space?",
      "choices": [
        "Reduced cost",
        "Faster speed",
        "Larger cargo capacity"
      ],
      "answer": "Reduced cost",
      "explanation": "A space elevator is projected to reduce the cost of launching cargo into space significantly, making it a more cost-effective option compared to rockets."
    },
    {
      "question": "What holds up the tether of a space elevator?",
      "choices": [
        "Counterweight",
        "Anchor",
        "Climber"
      ],
      "answer": "Counterweight",
      "explanation": "The counterweight at the top of the space elevator holds up the tether, providing the necessary tension to keep it stable and upright."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is one of the biggest challenges in building a space elevator?",
      "choices": [
        "Creating a strong and light tether material",
        "Designing the climber chamber",
        "Selecting the launch site"
      ],
      "answer": "Creating a strong and light tether material",
      "explanation": "One major challenge in constructing a space elevator is developing a material for the tether that is strong, light, and durable enough to withstand various environmental factors in space."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is the Moon proposed as a potential location for building a space elevator first?",
      "choices": [
        "Weaker gravity makes construction easier",
        "Closer proximity to Earth",
        "Existing infrastructure for space projects"
      ],
      "answer": "Weaker gravity makes construction easier",
      "explanation": "The weaker gravity on the Moon makes it a potentially easier location to build a space elevator, as it requires a less sturdy material for the tether due to lower gravitational forces."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is one potential risk associated with a space elevator breaking?",
      "choices": [
        "Debris posing a threat to spaceflight",
        "Loss of cargo capacity",
        "Impact on Earth's rotation"
      ],
      "answer": "Debris posing a threat to spaceflight",
      "explanation": "If a space elevator tether were to break, the resulting debris in orbit could pose serious risks to future space missions and spaceflight due to the potential hazards it would create."
