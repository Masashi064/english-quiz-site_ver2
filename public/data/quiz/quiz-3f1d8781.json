  "introduction": "We are trapped on earth. Controlled by an ancient debt to the universe...\n\nLearn more about Ariane 6",
  "lead_intro": "Space travel is an incredible feat, but have you ever wondered why it's so challenging for us to escape Earth's gravity? Let's dive into the science behind this cosmic predicament.",
  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "What phenomenon traps us on Earth and creates a 'gravity prison'?",
      "choices": [
        "electromagnetism",
        "gravity",
        "friction"
      ],
      "answer": "gravity",
      "explanation": "Gravity is the force that traps us on Earth, creating a 'gravity prison' due to the attraction between objects with mass."
    },
    {
      "question": "What concept explains the need to repay energy to escape Earth's gravity?",
      "choices": [
        "kinetic energy",
        "potential energy",
        "thermal energy"
      ],
      "answer": "potential energy",
      "explanation": "To escape Earth's gravity, we need to repay our energy debt by increasing our potential energy through rockets."

    {
      "question": "What is the main purpose of rockets in space travel?",
      "choices": [
        "generate electricity",
        "produce heat",
        "exchange energy"
      ],
      "answer": "exchange energy",
      "explanation": "Rockets exchange chemical energy into kinetic energy to propel spacecraft and repay the energy debt to gravity."

    {
      "question": "Why do rockets require more fuel as they get larger?",
      "choices": [
        "to reduce weight",
        "to increase speed",
        "to overcome mass inertia"
      ],
      "answer": "to overcome mass inertia",
      "explanation": "As rockets get larger, they require more fuel to overcome the increased mass inertia and lift off the ground."

    {
      "question": "What strategy is used to maintain orbit around Earth?",
      "choices": [
        "flying vertically",
        "flying horizontally",
        "hovering in place"
      ],
      "answer": "flying horizontally",
      "explanation": "To stay in orbit, rockets fly horizontally at high speeds so that the ground curves away beneath them, allowing them to remain in space."
