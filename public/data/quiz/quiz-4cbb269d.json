  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "What happens to the core of a massive star when it collapses under its own gravity?",
      "choices": [
        "Electrons merge into protons",
        "Particles decay away quickly",
        "Quarks separate into individual particles"
      ],
      "answer": "Electrons merge into protons",
      "explanation": "When a massive star's core collapses, electrons are pushed into protons, merging to form neutrons."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the environment like in the core of neutron stars?",
      "choices": [
        "Similar to a vacuum",
        "Extreme where nuclear physics rules change",
        "Filled with visible light"
      ],
      "answer": "Extreme where nuclear physics rules change",
      "explanation": "The core of neutron stars is so extreme that the rules of nuclear physics change, leading to strange matter."

      "question": "What is the term for a star made from a giant thing purely from quarks?",

        "Neutron star",
        "Supernova",
        "Quark Star"
      ],
      "answer": "Quark Star",
      "explanation": "A star made purely from quarks inside a neutron star core is called a Quark Star."

        "Liquid matter",
        "Strange matter",
        "Gas matter"
      ],
      "answer": "Strange matter",
      "explanation": "Strange matter, if formed, could be the ideal state of matter, perfectly dense and stable."

      "question": "What could strangelets do if they were to strike the Earth?",
      "choices": [
        "Create a new moon",
        "Convert it into strange matter",
        "Cause an earthquake"
      ],
      "answer": "Convert it into strange matter",
      "explanation": "If a strangelet were to hit Earth, it would immediately start converting it into strange matter, ultimately transforming it entirely."
