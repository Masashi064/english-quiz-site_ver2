  "introduction": "Fracking explained in five minutes.\n\nFracking is a controversial topic. On the one side the gas dril",
  "lead_intro": "Curious about hydraulic fracturing or fracking? Learn how this controversial method extracts natural gas from deep layers inside the earth.",
  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "What is the primary risk associated with fracking?",
      "choices": [
        "Contamination of drinking water sources",
        "Release of greenhouse gases",
        "Exhaustion of drill holes"
      ],
      "answer": "Contamination of drinking water sources",
      "explanation": "Fracking is primarily associated with the contamination of drinking water sources due to the large quantities of fresh water consumed and subsequent toxic contamination."
    },
    {
      "question": "What prevents the cracks in the rock layer from closing again during fracking?",
      "choices": [
        "Water",
        "Sand",
        "Chemicals"
      ],
      "answer": "Sand",
      "explanation": "Sand is used in the fracking fluid to prevent the cracks in the rock layer from closing again, allowing for the release of natural gas."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which greenhouse gas is largely present in the natural gas recovered by fracking?",
      "choices": [
        "Methane",
        "Carbon Dioxide",
        "Hydrogen"
      ],
      "answer": "Methane",
      "explanation": "The natural gas recovered by fracking largely consists of methane, a greenhouse gas that is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a consequence of about 3% of the recovered gas being lost in extraction and escaping into the atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Increased energy consumption",
        "Reduction in greenhouse gases",
        "Negative impact on climate balance"
      ],
      "answer": "Negative impact on climate balance",
      "explanation": "About 3% of the recovered gas being lost in extraction and escaping into the atmosphere contributes to the negative impact of fracking on the climate balance."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is the long-term consequence of fracking described?",
      "choices": [
        "Unforeseeable",
        "Highly beneficial",
        "Completely safe"
      ],
      "answer": "Unforeseeable",
      "explanation": "The long-term consequences of fracking are described as unforeseeable, emphasizing the uncertainty surrounding the risks and impacts of this extraction method."
