      "question": "What is the main concern regarding the creation of a superbacterium?",
      "choices": [
        "killing hundreds of millions of people",
        "wiping out all bacteria",
        "making antibiotics obsolete"
      ],
      "answer": "killing hundreds of millions of people",

      "question": "How do antibiotics primarily work against bacteria?",
      "choices": [
        "interfering with metabolism",
        "enhancing growth",
        "boosting DNA replication"
      ],
      "answer": "interfering with metabolism",
      "explanation": "Antibiotics disrupt the complex machinery of bacteria by interfering with their metabolism, slowing down growth, and making them less of a threat."
