  "lead_intro": "Did you know that genetic engineering could potentially help eradicate malaria by targeting mosquitoes? Test your knowledge with this quiz!",
  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "What is the main parasite responsible for causing malaria?",
      "choices": [
        "bacteria",
        "plasmodia",
        "virus"
      ],
      "answer": "plasmodia",
      "explanation": "Plasmodia are the group of micro-organisms that cause malaria."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do malaria parasites hide from the immune system after invading the liver?",
      "choices": [
        "transform into red blood cells",
        "infect the brain cells",
        "enter big cells"
      ],
      "answer": "enter big cells",
      "explanation": "Malaria parasites hide from the immune system by entering big cells in the liver."
    },
    {
      "question": "What revolutionary technology could potentially help eradicate malaria by genetically modifying mosquitoes?",
      "choices": [
        "CRISPR",
        "Cloning",
        "PCR"
      ],
      "answer": "CRISPR",
      "explanation": "CRISPR is a genetic engineering technology that can make large-scale changes to entire species."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do scientists ensure that the anti-malaria genetic modification spreads through mosquito populations effectively?",
      "choices": [
        "by releasing engineered mosquitoes in the wild",
        "only editing a few mosquitoes",
        "by waiting for natural selection"
      ],
      "answer": "by releasing engineered mosquitoes in the wild",
      "explanation": "Scientists use a genetic engineering method called gene drive to ensure that the anti-malaria gene spreads rapidly through mosquito populations."

    {
      "question": "What is one of the concerns associated with using genetic engineering to combat malaria?",
      "choices": [
        "parasites becoming stronger",
        "mosquitoes becoming extinct",
        "unintended consequences"
      ],
      "answer": "unintended consequences",
      "explanation": "One concern of genetic engineering for malaria control is the potential for unintended consequences when altering the genetic code of organisms."
