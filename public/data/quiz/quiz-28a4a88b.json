  "introduction": "The James Webb Space Telescope has dazzled us with its first batch of images. WIRED got in touch wit",
  "lead_intro": "The Webb Telescope has captured breathtaking images of celestial objects, revealing fascinating details about the universe. Let's explore some key takeaways from the video!",
  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "What type of wavelengths were used to capture the images shown in the video?",
      "choices": [
        "Visible light",
        "Infrared wavelengths",
        "Ultraviolet light"
      ],
      "answer": "Infrared wavelengths",
      "explanation": "The images were taken in infrared wavelengths (heat), allowing the telescope to detect objects that are not visible in regular light."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the red color in the images produced by the Webb Telescope indicate?",
      "choices": [
        "Objects moving slower",
        "Objects moving faster",
        "Objects of similar distance"
      ],
      "answer": "Objects moving faster",
      "explanation": "Objects that are farther away and moving faster appear redder in the images produced by the telescope."
    },
    {
      "question": "What celestial feature is depicted in the image discussed in the video?",
      "choices": [
        "Stellar nursery",
        "White dwarf star",
        "Supernova remnant"
      ],
      "answer": "White dwarf star",
      "explanation": "The image shows a white dwarf star at the center, which has thrown out most of its material and is glowing in white light."
    },
    {
      "question": "What element was found in the atmosphere of planet WASP-96b?",
      "choices": [
        "Oxygen",
        "Water vapor",
        "Carbon dioxide"
      ],
      "answer": "Water vapor",
      "explanation": "Water vapor was detected in the atmosphere of planet WASP-96b, suggesting the presence of common elements like water in distant planets."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is finding methane in the atmosphere of a distant planet significant?",
      "choices": [
        "Indicates presence of water",
        "Suggests extreme temperatures",
        "Implies potential for life"
      ],
      "answer": "Implies potential for life",
      "explanation": "The presence of methane in an atmosphere could indicate the existence of living organisms on that planet, raising the possibility of extraterrestrial life."
