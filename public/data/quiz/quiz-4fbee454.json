  "introduction": "Neutron Stars are some of the strangest things in the Universe. Not quite massive enough to become b",
  "lead_intro": "Neutron stars, among the most extreme objects in the universe, are like giant atom cores compressed to a tiny size. Let's dive into the fascinating world of neutron stars!",
  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "What is the final element that is fused in the core of a massive star before it collapses into a neutron star?",
      "choices": [
        "silicon",
        "oxygen",
        "iron"
      ],
      "answer": "iron",
      "explanation": "The fusion reaction in the core of a massive star eventually hits iron, which cannot fuse into another element, leading to a collapse and the formation of a neutron star."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the approximate diameter of a neutron star?",
      "choices": [
        "10 kilometers",
        "25 kilometers",
        "50 kilometers"
      ],
      "answer": "25 kilometers",
      "explanation": "A neutron star is compressed to an object about 25 kilometers wide, despite having a mass between 1 and 3 Suns."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the surface temperature of a neutron star compared to the Sun?",
      "choices": [
        "1,000 kelvin",
        "5,800 kelvin",
        "10,000 kelvin"
      ],
      "answer": "5,800 kelvin",
      "explanation": "The surface temperature of a neutron star is about 1 million kelvin, significantly higher than the Sun's surface temperature of 5,800 kelvin."
    },
    {
      "question": "What causes neutron stars to emit a strong radio signal, leading to them being called pulsars?",
      "choices": [
        "rapid rotation",
        "high surface temperature",
        "dense atmosphere"
      ],
      "answer": "rapid rotation",
      "explanation": "Neutron stars, especially young ones, can rotate several times per second, emitting a strong radio signal due to their rapid rotation, earning them the name 'pulsars.'"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the magnetic field strength of a neutron star compare to that of Earth?",
      "choices": [
        "100 times stronger",
        "1,000 times stronger",
        "8 trillion times stronger"
      ],
      "answer": "8 trillion times stronger",
      "explanation": "The magnetic field of a neutron star is roughly 8 trillion times stronger than that of Earth, influencing atoms and causing extreme magnetic effects."
