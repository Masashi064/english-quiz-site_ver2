  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "What is the name given to the tumours of tumours?",
      "choices": [
        "Hypertumours",
        "Hyperparasites",
        "Multitumours"
      ],
      "answer": "Hypertumours",
      "explanation": "Hypertumours are named after hyperparasites and are the tumours of tumours, where cancer cells turn against each other to cut off the blood supply."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which genes prevent critical mutations in cells or order the cell to self-destruct if beyond repair?",
      "choices": [
        "Proto-oncogenes",
        "Antagonist genes",
        "Tumour suppressor genes"
      ],
      "answer": "Tumour suppressor genes",
      "explanation": "Tumour suppressor genes prevent critical mutations and play a crucial role in regulating cell growth and division to prevent cancer development."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the biological paradox discussed in the video?",
      "choices": [
        "Peto's Paradox",
        "Darwin's Paradox",
        "Einstein's Paradox"
      ],
      "answer": "Peto's Paradox",
      "explanation": "Peto's Paradox refers to the surprising observation that large animals have much less cancer than expected based on their size and lifespan."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main way large animals combat the risk of cancer according to the video?",
      "choices": [
        "Evolving better cancer defenses",
        "Increasing their metabolic rate",
        "Reducing their cell size"
      ],
      "answer": "Evolving better cancer defenses",
      "explanation": "Large animals have evolved better cancer defenses, including an increased number of tumour suppressor genes, to require more mutations for tumour development."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do cancer cells work to build new blood vessels directly to the tumour?",
      "choices": [
        "To steal nutrients and energy",
        "To reduce the size of the tumour",
        "To enhance cell division"
      ],
      "answer": "To steal nutrients and energy",
      "explanation": "Cancer cells build new blood vessels to the tumour to steal nutrients and energy from the body, promoting the growth of the tumour at the expense of the host."
