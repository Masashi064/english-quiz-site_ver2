  "lead_intro": "Have you ever wondered what would happen if you shrank an elephant to the size of a mouse or enlarged a mouse to the size of an elephant? This video explores the fascinating reasons behind why such extreme size changes can have deadly consequences.",
  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "Why did the giant mouse explode when enlarged to the size of an elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Its cells produced too much heat",
        "It lacked the necessary energy",
        "Its surface area was insufficient"
      ],
      "answer": "Its cells produced too much heat",
      "explanation": "When the mouse was enlarged, it had significantly more volume filled with mitochondria producing heat, but its surface area to release that heat was inadequate, leading to an explosion."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do animal cells generate usable chemical energy?",
      "choices": [
        "By converting food and oxygen",
        "By storing sunlight",
        "By absorbing minerals"
      ],
      "answer": "By converting food and oxygen",
      "explanation": "Animal cells convert food and oxygen into usable chemical energy in mitochondria, which act as the powerhouse of the cell."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do bigger animals like elephants have evolved ways to get rid of heat more easily?",
      "choices": [
        "To prevent overheating and death",
        "To conserve energy",
        "To increase their metabolic rate"
      ],
      "answer": "To prevent overheating and death",
      "explanation": "Bigger animals like elephants have evolved features like huge flat ears to help dissipate heat more effectively, preventing them from overheating and dying due to excess heat generation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to an elephant if its cells suddenly become as active as those of a shrew?",
      "choices": [
        "It explodes due to excessive heat",
        "It shrinks in size",
        "It becomes more agile"
      ],
      "answer": "It explodes due to excessive heat",
      "explanation": "If an elephant's cells became as active as those of a shrew, an immense amount of heat would be generated, causing the elephant to explode due to the inability to dissipate that heat."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do baby mammals transition from being a part of their mother to individuals after birth?",
      "choices": [
        "Their internal processes speed up rapidly",
        "They become one with their mother",
        "They stop eating"
      ],
      "answer": "Their internal processes speed up rapidly",
      "explanation": "After birth, a baby mammal's internal processes speed up rapidly, transitioning them from being a part of their mother to becoming individuals in a matter of hours, with their metabolic rate increasing significantly."
