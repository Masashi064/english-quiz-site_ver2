    {
      "question": "How many cities with at least 100,000 inhabitants could be completely wiped out with the Earth's current nuclear arsenal?",
      "choices": [
        "1,500 cities",
        "2,000 cities",
        "3,000 cities"
      ],
      "answer": "1,500 cities",
      "explanation": "Assuming an average of three nuclear bombs needed to wipe out one city, the Earth's nuclear arsenal could destroy every single one of the approximately 4,500 cities or urban areas with at least 100,000 inhabitants."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the equivalent destructive power of the 15,000 nuclear warheads if detonated simultaneously?",
      "choices": [
        "3 billion tons of TNT",
        "5 billion tons of TNT",
        "7 billion tons of TNT"
      ],
      "answer": "3 billion tons of TNT",
      "explanation": "Fifteen thousand nuclear warheads would have the equivalent destructive power of three billion tons of TNT, which is enough to rebuild the entire island of Manhattan with stacks of TNT."

    {
      "question": "How does the energy released from detonating all nuclear weapons compare to a volcanic eruption?",
      "choices": [
        "15 times stronger than the Krakatoa eruption",
        "20 times stronger than the Krakatoa eruption",
        "25 times stronger than the Krakatoa eruption"
      ],
      "answer": "15 times stronger than the Krakatoa eruption",
      "explanation": "The energy released from detonating all nuclear weapons would be 15 times stronger than the deadly Krakatoa volcanic eruption that occurred in 1883."

    {
      "question": "What happens when the detonation of all nuclear weapons occurs in the Amazon rainforest?",
      "choices": [
        "A fireball vaporizes everything in its path",
        "A blast wave flattens 3,000 square kilometers of forest",
        "Living things within 250 kilometers will start to burn"
      ],
      "answer": "Living things within 250 kilometers will start to burn",
      "explanation": "The explosion leads to a fireball vaporizing everything in its path, a blast wave flattening a vast area of forest, and living things within 250 kilometers starting to burn."

      "question": "What would be the result if humanity mined all available uranium to build more nuclear bombs?",
      "choices": [
        "An extinction event",
        "Every large animal species would go extinct",
        "The planet would become uninhabitable"
      ],
      "answer": "An extinction event",
      "explanation": "If humanity mined all uranium to create a pile of nuclear bombs with extreme power, it would result in an extinction event, causing widespread destruction and the end of human civilization."
