    {
      "question": "What is parthenogenesis?",
      "choices": [
        "A type of asexual reproduction",
        "A type of sexual mating",
        "A type of genetic mutation"
      ],
      "answer": "A type of asexual reproduction",
      "explanation": "Parthenogenesis is a type of asexual reproduction where an embryo develops from an unfertilized egg cell that doubles its own chromosome count."

      "question": "Which animal species may have had the first account of parthenogenesis in smoothhound sharks?",
      "choices": [
        "Smoothhound sharks",
        "Komodo dragons",
        "Mayflies"
      ],
      "answer": "Smoothhound sharks",
      "explanation": "Ispera, the smoothhound shark born in captivity, may have been the first account of parthenogenesis in smoothhound sharks."

    {
      "question": "Why do scientists think parthenogenesis could be beneficial in some contexts?",
      "choices": [
        "It requires only one parent",
        "It involves complex mating rituals",
        "It leads to genetic mutations"
      ],
      "answer": "It requires only one parent",
      "explanation": "Parthenogenesis could be beneficial as it requires only one parent, reducing the time and energy-intensive mating rituals associated with sexual reproduction."

      "question": "What is the risk associated with parthenogenetic lineages according to Muller's ratchet theory?",
      "choices": [
        "Accumulation of harmful mutations",
        "Rapid population decline",
        "Increased genetic diversity"
      ],
      "answer": "Accumulation of harmful mutations",
      "explanation": "Muller's ratchet theory predicts that parthenogenetic lineages will accumulate harmful mutations over time, potentially leading to mutational meltdown and extinction."

      "question": "How have New Mexico whiptail lizards managed to survive as an all-female species?",
      "choices": [
        "By hybridizing two different lizard species",
        "By reproducing sexually and asexually",
        "By avoiding genetic diversity"
      ],
      "answer": "By hybridizing two different lizard species",
      "explanation": "New Mexico whiptail lizards survived as an all-female species by hybridizing two different lizard species, which gave them a high level of genetic diversity for long-term survival."
