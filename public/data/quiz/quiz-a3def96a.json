      "question": "How does the Ebola virus primarily survive and proliferate?",

        "by infecting cells",
        "by attacking the liver",
        "by causing internal bleeding"
      ],
      "answer": "by infecting cells",
      "explanation": "The Ebola virus can only survive and proliferate by infecting cells in the body."

        "neutrophils"
      ],
      "answer": "dendritic cells",
      "explanation": "One of the first cells Ebola takes over are dendritic cells, which are essential for immune response."

    {
      "question": "What happens to the infected dendritic cells once the Ebola virus enters them?",

        "They become virus production machines",
        "They self-destruct",
        "They attack other healthy cells"
      ],
      "answer": "They become virus production machines",
      "explanation": "Once infected, dendritic cells start producing Ebola viruses instead of activating anti-virus forces."

      "question": "What does Ebola manipulate the macrophages and monocytes to do?",
      "choices": [
        "signal to release fluid into the body",

        "prevent internal bleeding"
      ],
      "answer": "signal to release fluid into the body",
      "explanation": "Ebola manipulates some guard cells to signal blood vessels to release fluid into the body, causing mayhem."

      "question": "What is launched by the immune system as a last effort to fight Ebola?",
      "choices": [
        "a cytokine storm",

        "a viral replication process"
      ],
      "answer": "a cytokine storm",
      "explanation": "The immune system launches a cytokine storm, causing massive collateral damage in a desperate attempt to fight the virus."
