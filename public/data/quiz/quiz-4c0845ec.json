  "introduction": "Size is the most under appreciated regulators of living things. Let us demonstrate that by throwing",
  "lead_intro": "Have you ever wondered why a mouse can survive a fall from a skyscraper while an elephant can't? Let's dive into the fascinating world of size differences and how they affect living organisms.",
  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "Why did the mouse survive the fall from the skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "size",
        "gravity",
        "volume"
      ],
      "answer": "size",
      "explanation": "The mouse survived due to its smaller size, which resulted in less impact and kinetic energy upon hitting the ground compared to larger animals."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did the elephant explode upon hitting the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "surface tension",
        "volume",
        "air resistance"
      ],
      "answer": "volume",
      "explanation": "The elephant's large volume meant that a lot of kinetic energy was concentrated in a small space upon impact, leading to its explosive outcome."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do insects protect themselves from the strong force of water surface tension?",
      "choices": [
        "wax layer",
        "tiny hairs",
        "muscles"
      ],
      "answer": "wax layer",
      "explanation": "Insects have a thin layer of wax on their exoskeleton, making them at least partly water repellent and preventing water from sticking to them."
    },
    {
      "question": "What enables some insects to breathe underwater?",
      "choices": [
        "water-repelling hairs",
        "surface tension",
        "exoskeleton"
      ],
      "answer": "surface tension",
      "explanation": "Some insects carry an air bubble around them underwater, allowing them to breathe through the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, all thanks to surface tension."

    {
      "question": "How do Fairy Flies move through the air, considering their tiny size?",
      "choices": [
        "like swimming through syrup",
        "gliding effortlessly",
        "grabbing onto clouds"
      ],
      "answer": "like swimming through syrup",
      "explanation": "Fairy Flies move through the air by 'swimming' as air at their scale behaves like a thick, syrup-like substance around them, requiring them to grab and hold onto it for movement."
